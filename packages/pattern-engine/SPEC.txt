Chess Evolutionary Algorithm Spec

=== SUMMARY ===============================================================

This is a system for developing an evolutionary algorithm that can discover
the optimal move to make in a chess game.

Each player has a sorted list of patterns that describe the state of a game
board, and a move that can be made. This tuple is called an instruction.

On each turn, the system will get a players instruction set to see if any 
of the patterns match.

If an instruction matches, the system will check if the move is valid. If
the move is not valid, it continues searching. This process continues a
match with a valid move is found. If no match is found, the system will
pick a random move available to the player, and generate a new pattern
which includes the to/from squares of the move. This new instruction will
be added to the players entire instruction set.


=== PATTERNS ==============================================================

Patterns are a series of strings ('segments') that describe a square
location and what state the square should be in.

Locations can be represented in two formats, absolute and relative.

Absolute locations have a 1:1 correlation with a square on the board,
(eg: '!a1'). Whereas relative locations are relative to another square on
the board. These relative locations can either be the first the 'from'
square, or the 'to' square.

```
  start  a->h       1->8
%[f/t](+/-)${0-8}(+/-)${0-8}
```

The state can be described as either empty ('E'), friendly ('F'), a piece
that can be captured ('C'), or a piece with a specific color (eg: 'bq').

A complete representation of location and state would look like `!a1=bp`.

A pattern is a series of these individual segments. The total amount of 
segments is random, but with a min length of 2 and a max length of 32, 
with a bias towards generating in the middle of these values. The segments 
that represent the 'to' and 'from' must be absolute, and are stored
independently (see instruction data structure below).


=== INSTRUCTIONS ==========================================================

An instruction is a pattern <--> move tuple. The 'from' and 'to' squares
must be described within the pattern.

```
{
  move: {
    from: 'b2',
    to: 'b4',
  },
  pattern: `!a2=bp,!b2=bp,!b4=e`,
}
```

=== EVOLUTION PROCESS ====================================================

The process of iterating on the evolutionary algorithm requires going 
through the following steps to generate a fitness score,

1. Initiate two new instruction sets, assign each a color to play (black 
or white).
2. Start a new game of chess.
3. On each turn,
  A. Loop over each instruction, check if the pattern matches the board.
    I. If a pattern matches, and the move is valid, make the move and keep
       keep track of the pattern ID.
    II. If a pattern matches, and the move is invalid, keep searching.
    III. If no pattern matches, generate a new instruction and use that.
4. When the game ends, assess each player a fitness score (see below table)
   and apply it to each instruction that was used. Resort the instruction
   set based on the updated scores.

When this process has been repeated many times, you can "mate" two
different instruction sets by taking the top n% of instructions. For
mutating instruction sets, create x new instructions, and add them randomly
to the instruction set. 

This process repeats until an optimal solution is discovered.

Fitness points are awarded as follows,
* `+1` for each turn played.
* `+2` for capturing a piece.
* `-1` for losing a piece.
* `+3` for putting the king in check.
* `-1` for being put in check.
* `+5` for forcing draw (three-fold repition, etc).
* `-1` for being forced into a draw.
* `-10` for losing by checkmate.
* `+50` for checkmating.
